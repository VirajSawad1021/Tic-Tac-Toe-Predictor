# Tic-Tac-Toe Predictor

A machine learning-based web application that predicts whether **X** has won in a Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the current board state. Built with **Flask** for the backend, **Random Forest Classifier** for the model, and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend.

## Features
- **Board Input**: Users can input the current state of a Tic-Tac-Toe board (X, O, or blank).
- **Prediction**: The model predicts whether **X** has won the game.
- **Simple UI**: A clean and intuitive interface for entering board states and viewing predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For backend logic and machine learning.
- **Flask**: For the web application framework.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: For predicting game outcomes.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend interface.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [UCI Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/tic-tac-toe/tic-tac-toe.data), which contains all possible board configurations for Tic-Tac-Toe and their outcomes.
